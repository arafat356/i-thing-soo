        <h3>Short Paragraph on Success</h3>
        <p>
          To many people success means different things. Some people may see
          success as being rich and having all of the material things that
          anyone could ever dream of. Other people may see success as being in a
          place in their life that they never thought could happen. Some people
          may see owning their first home as being successful, while others see
          having a job they have always dreamed of as being a true success.

          If I were a king, I would have become a different personality. Because
          the responsibility of thousands of my subjects would have fallen on my
          shoulder. A king is like a father to his subjects. A king must protect
          the people living in his kingdom. He must look after their safety,
          food, education and health. A king should levy tax in such a way that
          the subjects could pay it without much strain on their part. As he
          draws tax, the majority of the money he should spend on their
          education, sanitary system, irrigation system, transport facilities,
          road, tanks, agricultural land, industry etc.

            If I become a king, I shall do all that. From time to time, I shall
            go out in my kingdom in the disguise of a common man to find out
            their genuine problems and try to solve them. As an administrator, I
            must be very strict and see that my employees do not tyrannize over
            the poor subjects. My army should be made well-equipped with modern
            weapons to fight any kind of calamity and be able to save my kingdom
            from the attack of the enemy.

            David was the second king of Israel and a descendant of Abraham. He
            was the youngest of eight brothers in his family (1Samuel 17:22) and
            was growing up as a shepherd (Bible Dictionary). He was the father
            of the well known king Solomon. In New Testament Jesus called as son
            of David. I am going to tell about Davidâ€™s life before he became a
            king; a description of his way of becoming a king of Israel. As a
            king he was righteous and brave. However, as far as I am concerned,
            his life before becoming a king was also interesting to know. I have
            chosen to concentrate particularly on this part of his life, because
            at that point he seemed to be an ordinary person like an average
            shepherd, but his great faith and believe in God gave him such a
            strength and bravery, that he managed to become a famous hero and
            king in the Biblical story of Israel.
